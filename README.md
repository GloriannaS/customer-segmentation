# Customer Segmentation


In this guided project, we will apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem. We have been provided with a dataset containing information about clients from a credit card company. Our objective is to partition the company's customers into distinct groups so that tailored business strategies can be developed for each segment.
